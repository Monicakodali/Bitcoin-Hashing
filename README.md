# Bitcoin-Hashing
Bitcoin hashing is mining bitcoins by generating random input strings and hashing them using the SHA256 algorithm. These mined coins were checked to ensure they had the required number of leading zeros in their prefix specified by the user. F# and AKKA actor model were used to build a good solution that runs efficiently on multi-core machines.
